{"name":"Hi, I'm James.","tagline":"I make websites.","body":"I've been swingin' both ways, working as both a back and front end web developer for around 6 years, primarily at [Springload](http://springload.co.nz), specialising in PHP, Javascript and CSS.\r\n\r\n## Recent projects\r\n### [NZ On Air: Irirangi Te Motu](http://nzonair.govt.nz)\r\n\r\n*Back-end*\r\n\r\nEach page of this site has such a range of content on it, we needed to find a new way for the client to edit things. We found the answer in [Sir Trevor](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/). We've created all kinds of custom blocks that the site administrators can now use when editing each page in our CMS, I don't know how we ever did content management without it!\r\n\r\n[![NZ On Air](images/nzonair.jpg)](http://nzonair.govt.nz)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### [Kiwibank Home Hunter](http://homehunter.co.nz)\r\n\r\n*Back-end*\r\n\r\nThis was an absolute epic project. Home Hunter is an app for browsing property listings, but you can also apply for a pre-approved home loan and get an indication of whether you can afford to buy each property. We needed to build not only the website but also the RESTful API that fuelled the website, iOS, and Android apps.\r\n\r\n[![Kiwibank Home Hunter](images/hh.jpg)](http://homehunter.co.nz)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### [Klim](http://klim.co.nz)\r\n\r\n*Back and front-end*\r\n\r\nKlim is milk spelled backwards. It is also the name of one of the world's leading type foundries. Kris (the owner) wanted us to create a new way for his customers to try out his fonts. We came up with a [simple and elegant tool](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/) where customers can create custom specimens using a mixture of fonts, and share them with friends.\r\n\r\n[![Klim](images/klim.png)](http://klim.co.nz)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### [Kiwibank](http://kiwibank.co.nz)\r\n\r\n*Back and front-end (massive group effort)*\r\n\r\nLarge corporate websites are always a challenge to try and keep simple. We've been working hard to make the majority of the site responsive and light weight (don't look at the personal banking section yet, it's next on the list!).\r\n\r\n[![Kiwibank](images/kb.png)](http://kiwibank.co.nz)\r\n\r\n## Other projects I've done\r\n\r\n(No link means that it is now deceased, or has since been redeveloped...)\r\n\r\n* [Wellington Jazz Festival 2014](http://jazzfestival.co.nz) - *Back-end*\r\n* [Kiwibank Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.kiwibank.mobile&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsIm56LmNvLmtpd2liYW5rLm1vYmlsZSJd) - *Front-end*\r\n* [Show Tools Mobile site](https://www.showtools.com/) - *Front-end*\r\n* [New Zealand International Arts Festival 2012](http://2012.festival.co.nz) - *Front-end*\r\n* NZ2011 (A site promoting NZ during the Rugby World Cup) - *Back and Front-end*\r\n* [ANZ Internet Banking redesign](https://secure.anz.co.nz/IBCS/pgLogin) - *Front-end*\r\n* [D*vice Redesign](http://dvice.co.nz/) - *Back-end*\r\n* Fringe Festival 2010 - *Front-end*\r\n* Springload Intranet - *Front-end*\r\n* Deaf Aotearoa - *Front-end*\r\n* [Capacity Redesign](http://www.capacity.net.nz/) - *Front-end*\r\n\r\n## Other projects I've maintained\r\n\r\n(Oh, glorious maintenance...)\r\n\r\n* [Wellington Airport](http://wellingtonairport.co.nz)\r\n* [Kiwibank Internet Banking](https://ib.www.kiwibank.co.nz)\r\n* [Forsyth Barr](http://forsythbarr.co.nz)\r\n* [Mysuper](http://mysuper.co.nz)\r\n* [Creative New Zealand](http://creativenz.govt.nz/)\r\n* [Jetty](http://www.jetty.co.nz/)\r\n* Chamber Music\r\n* [Al Brown](http://albrown.co.nz/)\r\n* [Showtools](https://www.showtools.com/)\r\n* [Interislander](http://interislander.co.nz)\r\n* [Kiwibank Renomate](http://renomate.kiwibank.co.nz)\r\n* [Loaded for Travel](http://www.loadedfortravel.co.nz/), [Christmas](http://www.loadedforchristmas.co.nz/), [Everyday](http://www.loadedeveryday.co.nz/) and [Prezzy Card](http://www.prezzycard.co.nz/)\r\n* [Right House](http://www.righthouse.co.nz/)\r\n* [Methven](http://www.methven.com/nz)\r\n* [Masterpet Business Website](http://business.masterpet.co.nz/)\r\n* [Queensland Tourism Council Business Barometer](http://www.businessbarometer.com.au/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
