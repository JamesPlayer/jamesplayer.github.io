We found the answer in [Sir Trevor](http://madebymany.github.io/sir-trevor-js/). We've created all kinds of custom blocks that the site administrators can now use when editing each page in our CMS, I don't know how we ever did content management without it!\r\n\r\n![NZ On Air](images/nzonair.jpg)\r\n\r\n### [Kiwibank Home Hunter](http://homehunter.co.nz)\r\nThis was an absolute epic project. Home Hunter is an app for browsing property listings, but you can also apply for a pre-approved home loan and get an indication of whether you can afford to buy each property. We needed to build not only the website but also the RESTful API that fuelled the website, iOS, and Android apps.\r\n\r\n![Kiwibank Home Hunter](images/hh.jpg)\r\n\r\n### [Klim](http://klim.co.nz)\r\n\r\n![Klim](images/klim.png)\r\n### [Kiwibank](http://kiwibank.co.nz)\r\n\r\n![Kiwibank](images/kb.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
